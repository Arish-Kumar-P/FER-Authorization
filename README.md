This is basically an Authorization model which works based on facial expressions. Face expression recognition method based on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an image edge detection is proposed. Firstly, the facial expression image is normalized, and the edge of each layer of the image is extracted in the convolution process. The extracted edge information is superimposed on each feature image to preserve the edge structure information of the texture image. Then, the dimensionality reduction of the extracted implicit features is processed by the maximum pooling method. Finally, the expression of the test sample image is classified and recognized by using a Softmax classifier. To verify the robustness of this method for facial expression recognition under a complex background, a simulation experiment is designed by scientifically mixing the Fer-2013 facial expression database with the LFW data set.
